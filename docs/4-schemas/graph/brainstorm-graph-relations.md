### 2. Data Models
- **Documents**: Core content containers with metadata
- **Classifications**: Content categorization and routing rules
- **Relationships**: Inter-document connections and dependencies
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all system actions

### 3. Graph Database Layer
The regulatory domain has inherently interconnected data that benefits from graph representation:

Key Relationships:
- Product registrations across multiple states
- Dependencies between regulatory documents
- Client hierarchies and product families
- Document version chains and amendments
- Cross-reference between related applications

Example Use Cases:
- Tracking cascading regulatory requirements
- Impact analysis when regulations change
- Finding all affected products for a specific regulatory update
- Identifying common patterns in successful registrations
- Relationship-based search and discovery

A graph database makes particular sense in this application for several reasons:

1. **Complex Relationships**: The regulatory domain has many many-to-many relationships:
   - One product can be registered in multiple states
   - One regulatory change can affect multiple products
   - Multiple documents can be related to multiple registrations
   - Products can have parent-child relationships

2. **Impact Analysis**: When regulatory changes occur, we need to quickly traverse relationships to understand:
   - Which products are affected?
   - Which clients need to be notified?
   - What documents need updates?

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Graph structures can help identify:
   - Common successful registration patterns
   - Regulatory requirement similarities across states
   - Product family relationships

4. **Performance**: Graph databases excel at relationship-heavy queries that would be complex and slow in traditional relational databases, especially when dealing with multiple levels of relationships or path finding.

The graph database would work alongside the existing document storage system, focusing on managing relationships while the document storage handles the actual content. This hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds - efficient document storage and powerful relationship management.
