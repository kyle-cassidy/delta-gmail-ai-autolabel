# Progress Report: PaLIGemma Model Integration and Documentation Updates
Date: January 15, 2025

## Major Achievements

### 1. PaLIGemma Model Integration
- Successfully deployed PaLIGemma model on Google Cloud Vertex AI
- Implemented prediction utilities with proper authentication
- Moved model code to `src/models/paligemma` for better code organization
- Set up service account with appropriate IAM roles for model access

### 2. Documentation Enhancements
- Added comprehensive documentation overview
- Created presentation slides for project communication
- Established structured documentation directory
- Added system architecture documentation
- Introduced detailed design documents

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements
- Added Codecov configuration with 80% coverage target

## Technical Details

### PaLIGemma Integration
- Model endpoint: `projects/13869043942/locations/us-central1/endpoints/3233752757731065856`
- Service account roles:
  - `roles/viewer`
  - `roles/aiplatform.user`
  - `roles/aiplatform.modelUser`
- Successfully tested model predictions with sample inputs

### Code Organization
- Restructured project to follow clean architecture principles
- Model code now lives in `src/models/paligemma/`
- Clear separation between model deployment and prediction utilities

## Next Steps
