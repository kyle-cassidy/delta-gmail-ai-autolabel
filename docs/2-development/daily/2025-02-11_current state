Let me help us understand the current state of the project based on the provided codebase context.

## Project Overview
We're building an automated email processing system for Delta Analytical Corporation that handles regulatory documentation and compliance. The system is designed to process incoming emails from `biofertregistration@delta-ac.com`, classify them, and integrate with Airtable (and eventually PostgreSQL).

## Core Components

1. **Email Processing Pipeline**

```17:24:docs/0-overview/documentation_overview.md
1. **First Contact**
   When an email arrives in our inbox, our system springs to life. It immediately begins analyzing the sender, subject, and content. But before anything else happens, a crucial security check occurs. Our security vetting module scans for potential threats - phishing attempts, malware, or suspicious patterns that could compromise our system.

2. **Understanding the Content**
   Once an email passes security, the real magic begins. Our system doesn't just read - it understands. Using advanced natural language processing, it:
   - Extracts key information from email bodies
   - Processes attachments (PDFs, Excel files, Word documents)
   - Identifies critical entities like company names, product codes, and registration numbers
```


2. **Architecture**
The system follows a microservices-like architecture with these key components:
- Email Monitoring Service (Gmail API integration)
- Security Module
- Content Processing Engine
- Classification System
- Data Integration Layer

## Current Development State

1. **Classification System**
We're currently working on email classification with a YAML-based configuration:

```4:15:config/email_tags.yaml
email_tags:
  required:
    state_code: string # Two-letter state code (e.g., "CA", "NY")
    company_code: string # Three letter company code (e.g., "ARB", "BIN")
    action_type: string # Reference to regulatory_actions (e.g., "registration")

  optional:
    urgency: string # High, Medium, Low
    response_needed: boolean # True/False
    deadline: string # ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    product_type: string # Reference to product_categories (e.g., "fertilizer.commercial")
    notes: string # Any additional notes
```


2. **Database Migration**
We're in the process of migrating from Airtable to PostgreSQL, with a phased approach:
- Phase 1: One-way sync from Airtable to PostgreSQL
- Phase 2: Two-way sync with conflict resolution

3. **Testing Status**
Current test coverage shows some issues:

```50:60:docs/2-development/progress/daily/2025-01-14-test-suite-enhancement.md
### 1. Gmail Client Tests (4 failures)
- Method name mismatches (get_message vs get_messages)
- OAuth credential mocking issues
- Missing label modification methods
- Universe domain mismatch in credentials

### 2. Message Class Tests (2 failures)
- Constructor parameter mismatches
- Missing labels property implementation
- Attachment handling issues

```


4. **Integration Progress**
- PaLIGemma model has been successfully deployed on Google Cloud Vertex AI
- Gmail API integration is functional but needs test fixes
- Airtable integration is active and serving as the primary database

## Next Major Milestones

1. **Database Migration**

```124:130:docs/1-architecture/integrations/db_project_instructions.md
## Next Steps

1. Review and refine schema design
2. Create test environment
3. Develop initial migration tools
4. Set up monitoring systems
5. Begin test migrations
```


2. **Classification Enhancement**
- Improve classification accuracy
- Implement feedback loops
- Add more contextual rules

3. **UI Development**
A prototype interface is being developed with:
- Email list view
- Label management
- Classification status display
- Manual override capabilities

The project appears to be in active development with several parallel workstreams, focusing on improving classification accuracy while preparing for a major database migration.
