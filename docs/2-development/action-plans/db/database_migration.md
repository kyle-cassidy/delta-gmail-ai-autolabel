**Proposed Implementation Task List**

1. **Branch Setup**  
   - [ ] Create a new development branch following the required naming convention (e.g., `feature/GH-123-airtable-migration`).

2. **Environment & Configuration**  
   - [ ] Confirm local environment mirrors production settings.  
   - [ ] Validate access keys, credentials, and environment variables for Airtable and PostgreSQL.  
   - [ ] Set up Postgres migrations and verify schema definitions.

3. **Field Mapping & Transformation**  
   - [ ] Identify Airtable fields that map to each corresponding Postgres column.  
   - [ ] Define any required transformations, such as normalizing date formats, trimming strings, or handling enumerations.  
   - [ ] Update Pydantic schemas (if used) to reflect the expected data format.

4. **Data Extraction & Loading**  
   - [ ] Implement a data-loading routine to query records from Airtable.  
   - [ ] Convert extracted records into Python objects aligned with the SQLAlchemy models.  
   - [ ] Ensure all relationships (foreign keys, one-to-many links) are mapped correctly.

5. **Validation & Error Handling**  
   - [ ] Integrate thorough validation checks for incoming Airtable data.  
   - [ ] Implement logging for any invalid fields, missing references, or other issues.  
   - [ ] Decide on remediation steps (retry, discard, prompt manual fix) for failed records.

6. **Audit & Versioning**  
   - [ ] Confirm that audit triggers in Postgres capture inserts, updates, and deletes as planned.  
   - [ ] Consider implementing a lightweight versioning approach or “soft deletes” for historical references.  
   - [ ] Review compliance requirements, especially regarding data retention and regulatory traces.

7. **Incremental & Two-Way Sync**  
   - [ ] Implement logic to detect only new or changed records in Airtable.  
   - [ ] Decide how to handle two-way updates (if relevant): define conflict-resolution rules or prioritize authoritative sources.  
   - [ ] Test performance with incremental updates vs. full table sync.

8. **Testing & QA**  
   - [ ] Run a small batch of sample records through the pipeline, confirming data accuracy in Postgres.  
   - [ ] Address any data discrepancies, key constraints, or anomalies.  
   - [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure robust coverage.

9. **Performance Optimization**  
   - [ ] Add indexes to frequently queried columns or relationships.  
   - [ ] Assess batch importing vs. single-record inserts if large volumes are expected.  
   - [ ] Explore any needed caching or concurrency controls.

10. **Documentation & Rollout**  
   - [ ] Provide clear documentation on how to run and maintain the migration scripts.  
   - [ ] Outline troubleshooting steps and known edge cases.  
   - [ ] Plan the rollout schedule for production.
