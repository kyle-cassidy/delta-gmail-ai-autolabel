# Automated Classification System

## Overview
An intelligent system that automatically processes and classifies incoming registration-related emails, learning and improving its accuracy over time. The system combines pattern recognition, historical data, and contextual awareness to accurately classify documents and update Airtable records.

## Key Components

### 1. Pattern Recognition Engine
```python
class PatternEngine:
    """Identifies document types and key information"""
    async def learn_patterns(self, examples: List[Document]) -> List[Pattern]:
        """Learn patterns from example documents"""
        pass

    async def extract_info(self, document: Document) -> ExtractionResult:
        """Extract key information using learned patterns"""
        pass

    async def validate_extraction(self, result: ExtractionResult) -> float:
        """Calculate confidence score for extraction"""
        pass
```

### 2. State-Specific Processors
```python
@dataclass
class StateProcessor:
    """State-specific document processing rules"""
    state: str
    approval_patterns: List[Pattern]
    registration_format: str
    expiration_rules: ExpirationRule
    required_fields: List[str]

class StateProcessorRegistry:
    """Registry of state-specific processors"""
    async def get_processor(self, state: str) -> StateProcessor:
        """Get processor for specific state"""
        pass

    async def learn_state_patterns(self, state: str, examples: List[Document]) -> None:
        """Learn patterns for specific state"""
        pass
```

### 3. Confidence Scoring System
```python
class ConfidenceScorer:
    """Calculates confidence scores for classifications"""
    async def calculate_confidence(
        self, 
        extraction: ExtractionResult,
        context: ProcessingContext
    ) -> float:
        """Calculate overall confidence score"""
        pass

    async def explain_score(
        self, 
        confidence: float
    ) -> List[ConfidenceFactor]:
        """Explain factors affecting confidence score"""
        pass
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Pattern Recognition
1. Implement base pattern recognition for common formats
2. Create initial state processors for top priority states
3. Build basic confidence scoring

### Phase 2: Learning System
1. Add example-based learning
2. Implement pattern refinement
3. Build error correction feedback loop

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add contextual awareness
2. Implement cross-document verification
3. Build automated quality control

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Pattern Storage
```python
@dataclass
class Pattern:
    """Represents a learned pattern"""
    pattern_type: str
    regex: str
    confidence: float
    learned_from: List[str]
    success_rate: float
    last_updated: datetime
```

### 2. Learning Strategy
- Use supervised learning from manual corrections
- Implement pattern generalization
- Build pattern verification system

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Cache commonly used patterns
- Implement batch processing
- Use async processing for scale
