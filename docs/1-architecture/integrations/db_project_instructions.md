# Delta Analytics Database Migration Project

## Project Overview
Migration of Delta Analytical Corporation's Airtable-based registration tracking system to PostgreSQL, with a focus on maintaining data integrity, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.

## Core Objectives
1. Create a robust PostgreSQL database that enhances the current Airtable system
2. Implement a reliable data migration strategy
3. Establish synchronization between Airtable and PostgreSQL
4. Maintain complete audit trails for all data changes
5. Support future application development needs

## Technical Requirements

### Database Design
- Implement proper data normalization
- Use PostgreSQL-specific features for performance and integrity
- Maintain mappings to Airtable for synchronization
- Support full audit logging of all changes
- Enable efficient querying of registration status
- Support document and attachment management

### Data Migration
- Validate data before migration
- Handle data type conversions
- Preserve historical data
- Maintain data relationships
- Provide rollback capabilities
- Verify data integrity post-migration

### Synchronization
- Phase 1: 
  - One-way sync from Airtable to PostgreSQL
  - core implementation of main tables: registration-tracking, clients, and state regulators tables
- Phase 2: 
  - Two-way sync with conflict resolution
  - Track sync status and history
  - Handle error cases gracefully
  - Maintain audit trail of sync operations

### Security & Compliance
- Implement proper access controls
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Maintain NIST compliance standards
- Support regulatory audit requirements
- Implement proper backup procedures

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Finalize PostgreSQL schema design
2. Create initial migration scripts
3. Implement data validation
4. Set up audit logging
5. Create test environment

### Phase 2: Migration
1. Develop migration tools
2. Perform test migrations
3. Validate data integrity
4. Document migration procedures
5. Create rollback procedures

### Phase 3: Synchronization
1. Implement one-way sync from Airtable
2. Add sync monitoring and logging
3. Develop sync error handling
4. Create sync management tools
5. Test sync reliability

### Phase 4: Applications
1. Create API layer for database access
2. Implement security controls
3. Develop admin interfaces
4. Create reporting tools
5. Build monitoring systems

## Conventions

### Coding Standards
- Use clear, descriptive names for database objects
- Implement consistent naming patterns
- Document all complex triggers and functions
- Use proper data types and constraints
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices

### Documentation
- Maintain schema documentation
- Document all triggers and functions
- Keep migration procedures updated
- Document sync processes
- Track all schema changes

### Testing
- Create test data sets
- Implement automated testing
- Validate data integrity
- Test sync operations
- Verify audit logging

## Key Considerations

### Data Integrity
- Validate all data during migration
- Implement proper constraints
- Use transactions appropriately
- Maintain referential integrity
- Preserve audit history

### Performance
- Optimize schema for common queries
- Create appropriate indexes
- Monitor query performance
- Optimize sync operations
- Handle large datasets efficiently

### Scalability
- Design for data growth
- Plan for increased usage
- Consider future features
- Support multiple applications
- Enable easy schema updates

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine schema design
2. Create test environment
3. Develop initial migration tools
4. Set up monitoring systems
5. Begin test migrations
