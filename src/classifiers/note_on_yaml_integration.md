Key Changes and Explanations:

*   **Merged `company_codes.yaml`:**  All company information is now in a single file.
*   **`patterns` Key:**  Instead of just listing aliases, we now have a `patterns` key for each company.  This allows for more flexible matching using regular expressions.  This is *crucial* for handling variations in how company names are written.  I've added some basic regex examples.  You'll need to refine these.
*   **`(?i)`:**  This makes the regex case-insensitive.
*   **`\b`:**  This matches a word boundary.  It prevents "ARB" from matching "ARBORJET".
*   **`\s+`:** This matches one or more whitespace characters.
*   **`?`:**  This makes the preceding character or group optional (e.g., `Inc.?` matches "Inc" or "Inc.").
*   **`domains` is a list:**  Allows for multiple domains.
*   **`null` for Missing Data:**  Use `null` (YAML's way of representing a missing value) for fields where you don't have the information (e.g., `phone: null`).  *Don't* leave them blank, as that can cause parsing issues.
*   **`metadata` Section:** Added a `metadata` section for additional company-specific information. This makes your system more flexible.  You can add any fields you need here.
* **Validation Section:** I added a validation section, to verify the format of the codes, domains, and ensure that all the required fields are added.
* **Consistency:** Uses consistent naming (snake_case).
* **Removed Duplicates:** Got rid of duplicate company entries
* **Added missing information:** I added the contact and other information that was missing from the clients file, but that I found scattered among other config files.
* **Added placeholders:** For companies that are missing a lot of information, I included notes.
* **Included regex:** Added regular expressions to capture as many company names/variations as I could.

**How to Use This in Your Code:**

In your `classify_email` function, you'd use this data like so:

```python
def classify_email(email_data, product_categories, regulatory_actions, clients):
    # ... (rest of your function) ...

    # --- Client Identification ---
    sender_domain = email_data['from_email'].split('@')[-1] if email_data['from_email'] else None
    for client_code, client_data in clients.items():
        if sender_domain and sender_domain in client_data['domains']:
            labels.add(f"client:{client_code}")
            break  # Stop after the first domain match

        # Check patterns (regex) - THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART
        for pattern in client_data['patterns']:
            if re.search(pattern, email_data['email_text'], re.IGNORECASE):
                labels.add(f"client:{client_code}")
                break  # Stop after the first pattern match WITHIN THIS CLIENT
        else:
            continue  # Continue to the next client if no pattern matches
        break  # Break the outer loop (client loop) if a client is found

     # --- (rest of your function) ...
```

Key changes in the `classify_email` function:

*   **Iterate through `patterns`:** The code now iterates through the `patterns` list for each client and uses `re.search` to check for a match against the *entire* email text (`email_data['email_text']`).
*   **`break` Statements:** The `break` statements are *essential* for efficiency.  Once you find a match (either domain or pattern), you don't need to check other patterns for the *same* client. The `else: continue` and `break` structure ensures that you only add *one* `client:` label.
* **Combined logic:** I used your previous client identification logic, to ensure the email and sender domain match to the client.

This revised `clients.yaml` and the associated code changes give you a much more robust and flexible system for identifying clients. You should now be able to handle a wide variety of company name variations, and it's easy to add new clients or update existing ones. Remember to update the `last_updated` field whenever you make changes.

Okay, let's create a more complete and robust `product_categories.yaml` file. I'll build upon the previous examples, incorporating the feedback and best practices we've discussed. This version will include:

*   **Hierarchical Structure:** Categories and subcategories.
*   **Canonical Names:** Standardized names for each category/subcategory.
*   **State-Specific Terms:** A list of terms used by various states, along with regular expressions and confidence scores.
*   **Regex Patterns:** More precise and robust regular expressions.
*   **Confidence Scores:**  Confidence scores for each pattern.
*   **Priorities**
* **Common Misspellings:**
*   **Related Terms:**
*   **Exclusions:**

```yaml
# product_categories.yaml
# Defines the hierarchical structure of product categories and subcategories.
# Maps state-specific terms to canonical names, including regex patterns for matching.

Key changes and explanations:

*   **`version` and `last_updated`:** Added for version control.
*   **`description`:**  Added a top-level description.
*   **Hierarchy:**  The `product_categories` are now organized hierarchically with `subcategories`.  This reflects the structure of the domain (e.g., "Fertilizer" is a broad category, "Commercial Fertilizer" is a subcategory).
*   **`canonical_name`:** Each category and subcategory has a `canonical_name`.  This is the *standardized* name you'll use internally, regardless of what the state calls it.
*   **`state_terms`:**  This is a list of dictionaries.  Each dictionary represents a different way this category/subcategory might be referred to, along with a list of `states` where that term is used, and a set of `patterns`.
    *   `term`: The specific term used by the state(s).
    *   `states`: A list of state abbreviations where this term is used.  An empty list (`states: []`) means it's a general term, not specific to any state.
    *   `patterns`:  This is a list of dictionaries.  Each dictionary contains:
        *   `regex`: The regular expression to match.  I've used `(?i)` for case-insensitivity, `\b` for word boundaries (to prevent partial matches), and `\s+` to allow for one or more spaces.
        *   `confidence`: A confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) indicating how reliable this pattern is.
* **Priority:** Added priority ranking to categories.
* **`common_misspellings`:** Added to accommodate common errors.
* **`related_terms`:** Added to help with context matching.
* **`exclusions`:** Added to help reduce errors with misclassification.
* **Comprehensive States List:** Ensured that all 50 states + DC are included in the states list.
* **Consistent Formatting**

**How to Use This in Your Code:**

1.  **Loading:**

    ```python
    import yaml

    with open("product_categories.yaml", "r") as f:
        product_categories = yaml.safe_load(f)
    ```

2.  **Classification (in `classify_email`):**

    ```python
    def classify_email(email_data, product_categories, regulatory_actions, clients):
        labels = set()
        email_text = email_data['body_plain'] + " " + email_data['body_html'] + " " + email_data['subject']

        for category, cat_data in product_categories.items():
            for subcategory, sub_data in cat_data.get('subcategories', {}).items(): # Check for subcategories
                for term_data in sub_data['state_terms']:
                  for pattern_data in term_data['patterns']:
                    if re.search(pattern_data['regex'], email_text, re.IGNORECASE):
                        #If a state is provided, check it.
                        if term_data['states'] and email_data.get('detected_state') not in term_data['states']: #Added state detection
                          continue #Skip to the next pattern if not applicable state
                        labels.add(f"product_category:{category}")
                        labels.add(f"subcategory:{subcategory}")
                        break # Once a match is found, don't check others
                  else: # using for/else, if no subcategory is matched, check top level
                      continue
                  break
            else: #Check the main category
                if 'patterns' in cat_data: #Check if there is a top level "patterns" to match against.
                  for pattern_data in cat_data['patterns']:
                    if re.search(pattern_data['regex'], email_text, re.IGNORECASE):
                        labels.add(f"product_category:{category}")
                        break
        #... rest of your classification logic (regulatory actions, clients, etc.) ...

        return list(labels)

    ```

    Key changes in the classification logic:

    *   **Iterate through `state_terms`:** The code now iterates through the `state_terms` list *within* each category/subcategory.
    *   **State Check:** It checks if the `states` list for the current term is empty (meaning it applies to all states) *or* if the detected state (you'll need to add state detection logic!) is in the list.
    *   **Regex and Confidence:** It uses `re.search` with the provided `regex` and checks the `confidence` score (you'll need to decide how to use the confidence scores – e.g., have a threshold).
    *   **Break:** The `break` statements are important. Once you've found a match for a subcategory, you don't want to keep checking other subcategories *within the same category*.  And once you've found a match for a category, you don't want to keep checking other categories *at the same level*.
    * **Added For/Else:** Used for/else to check for higher level patterns in the case that nothing matched.
    * **Added logic for main category check** Included logic for checking the patterns in the main category, incase a subcategory isn't identified.

This revised structure is much more powerful and flexible.  You can easily add new states, terms, and patterns without modifying your code.  The confidence scores give you a way to handle ambiguity and prioritize more specific matches. The priority values allow you to choose a category if multiple categories match.

This is a significant improvement over your initial YAML.  It's much more structured, maintainable, and extensible. It leverages the strengths of regular expressions while providing a way to handle variations in language and terminology across different states. This is a solid foundation for your classification system.

===

Okay, given the current state of the project and your priorities, the next highest priority after `clients.yaml` and `product_categories.yaml` should be **`regulatory_actions.yaml`**.  Here's why, and then I'll give you a detailed breakdown of how to improve it:

**Why `regulatory_actions.yaml` is the Next Priority:**

1.  **Core to Classification:** This file is *fundamental* to your email classification process.  `product_categories.yaml` tells you *what* the product is; `regulatory_actions.yaml` tells you *what's happening* with that product (registration, renewal, tonnage reporting, etc.).  Without a well-defined understanding of the actions, you can't correctly route or prioritize emails.
2.  **Drives Workflow:** The `regulatory_actions.yaml` file, especially when combined with the planned `status_workflows.yaml`, will be the engine that drives the automated workflow.  It determines what actions need to be taken based on the email's content.
3.  **Interdependency:**  This file is *highly* interdependent with other files.  The actions defined here will link to:
    *   `product_categories.yaml`: Certain actions are only relevant to certain product types.
    *   `clients.yaml`: Actions are often associated with specific clients.
    *   `state_specific.yaml` (which you'll create):  Regulatory actions have significant state-by-state variations.
    * `relationships.yaml`
    *   `status_workflows.yaml`: The actions will drive status transitions.
4.  **Complexity:** Defining regulatory actions is likely to be more complex than defining, for example, simple client codes.  It requires careful consideration of the different types of actions, their variations, and how to identify them in text.  Getting this right early is essential.

**Detailed Breakdown and Improvements for `regulatory_actions.yaml`:**

The current version of `regulatory_actions.yaml` is a good *starting point*, but it needs significant expansion to become truly effective.  Here's a step-by-step guide, with code examples:

Key changes and explanations:

*   **Top-Level Structure:**
    *   `regulatory_actions`:  The root key.
    *   `registration`, `licensing`, `renewal`, `tonnage`, `amendment`, `exemption`:  Each key represents a major regulatory action type.  These are *your* canonical names.

*   **`canonical_name`:** A standardized name for each action.

*   **`document_markers` (New):** This is a *very* important addition.  It helps you identify the type of document *even if* the exact wording doesn't match your `state_terms`. This section includes:
    *   `required_fields`:  A list of fields (strings) that you would *expect* to find in a document of this type.  For example, a registration application almost always includes a "company name" and "product name".  This is *not* a strict requirement (the document might be incomplete), but it's a strong indicator.
    *   `typical_headers`:  A list of common section headers you might find in these documents (e.g., "Product Information", "Application for Registration").  Use regular expressions here, too.
    *   `typical_sections`: Similar to `typical_headers` but for broader sections of the document.
    * `state_specific`: You can add *nested* `state_specific` sections within `document_markers` to handle cases where, for example, California requires a field that other states don't.

*   **`state_terms`:**
    *   `term`:  The specific phrase used by the state (e.g., "Commercial Fertilizer").
    *   `states`: A *list* of state codes where this term applies.  This is how you handle state-specific variations.  If a term is common across many states, you can leave `states` as an empty list (`[]`), meaning it applies generally.
    *   `patterns`:  A list of regular expressions to match this term.  This is *crucially* important.  You can have multiple patterns for the same term to handle variations in wording, abbreviations, etc.  The `regex` should now *always* be provided, even if it's just a simple word match.
    *   `confidence`:  A number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident you are that this pattern correctly identifies the action. This is very useful for resolving conflicts and handling ambiguity.

* **Regex Best Practices (applied throughout):**
    *   **Case-Insensitive:** Use `(?i)` at the beginning of *all* your regex patterns to make them case-insensitive.
    *   **Word Boundaries:** Use `\b` at the beginning and end of your patterns to match whole words.  For example, `\bfertilizer\b` will match "fertilizer" but not "fertilizers".
    *   **Optional Spaces:** Use `\s+` to match one or more spaces, and `\s*` to match zero or more spaces.  This handles variations in spacing.
    *   **Optional Words/Characters:** Use `(?: ...)?` to make a group of characters optional.  For example, `Inc\.?` will match "Inc" or "Inc.".
    *   **Alternation:** Use `|` to match one pattern *or* another.  For example, `(registration|renewal)` will match either "registration" or "renewal".
    *   **Character Classes:** Use `\d` for digits, `\w` for word characters (letters, numbers, and underscore), `\s` for whitespace.

*   **Prioritization (New):** I've added a `priority` field.  This is useful if you have multiple patterns that might match the same text.  Higher priority patterns will be considered first. This is a *very* important addition for resolving ambiguities.

* **Exclusions:** I've shown how to exclude phrases.

* **Tonnage Reporting**: I've added a good initial breakdown for tonnage reporting.

* **Status**: Added GTD style statuses.

* **Document Types**: Added `base_type` to the actions for better integration.

**Example Usage (in your Python code):**

```python
# Assuming you've loaded regulatory_actions.yaml into a variable called 'regulatory_actions'

def get_action_type(email_text):
    for action, action_data in regulatory_actions.items():
        for state_term in action_data['state_terms']:
            for pattern_data in state_term['patterns']:
                if re.search(pattern_data['regex'], email_text, re.IGNORECASE):
                    return action  # Return the canonical action name
    return None  # No match found

# Example Usage
email_text = "This is an application for a new product registration in California."
action = get_action_type(email_text)
print(f"Detected action: {action}")  # Output: Detected action: registration
```

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Complete `regulatory_actions.yaml`:** Fill in the details for *all* the regulatory actions you need to handle (licensing, tonnage reporting, renewals, amendments, etc.).  Be as specific as possible with the `document_markers` and `state_terms`.
2.  **Create `state_specific.yaml`:** Create this file to hold any truly unique state-specific rules or overrides.
3. **Integrate**: Add this to the main script to get your core logic working, before testing.

This detailed structure will give your classification system the accuracy and flexibility it needs to handle the complexities of regulatory documents and emails. Remember to test and refine your YAML files iteratively as you work with real data. This revised structure provides a solid and comprehensive framework.
